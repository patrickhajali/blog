| :--: | :--: |
| *Signal Processing / Neuroscience*<br>Analyze LFP recordings, generate nice visualizations,<br>publish replicable code<br> | I want to see what it's like to work with biological data, which I find interesting in its own right. Also a good opportunity to refresh signal-processing knowledge. <br>Added bonus: aligns well with what Synchron is working on, so good interview/discussion prep. |
| *MCTS Framework around LLMs*<br>Build a learning framework levaraging LLMs and potentially <br>other tools. Need to determine idea specs (i.e. what are you trying to learn) | I believe this is where things (agentic systems) are headed and I am very excited to build a prototype of this approach to prove its possible. <br>I think I would learn useful skills: architecting a large app, building around LLM APIs (trendy right now), programming for high throughput, putting vague ideas to code. |
| *App-ify above (or something else)*<br>Develop a front-end UI or basic display/visualization. Make an interactive web app<br>for the above. | I'm motivated to do this mainly to create a platform to present what I've done and possibly have user's interact with the system. This brings the project "to life". <br>Also excited to learn skills in front-end development, deploying an app on a server, connecting to a database, using cloud services (potentially). I want to learn these skills to broaden my skillset and have an understanding of how these things are done. |
| *Learn about state-space models*<br>Spend a few days getting a good understanding of the internals of state-space models, spend a few days implementing a "baby" version | I see the connection between my EE-knowledge and these systems. They seem to be growing in popularity and can become important in the future. Would be good to know about them. <br>Good opportunity to develop skills in going from math to software implementation, albeit PyTorch most-likely, but still. Not much online to go off of, so would be a good challenge. |

So, **what to do**?

Well, I've already made significant progress on the signal-processing project. I will wrap this up today / this-weekend, publish the code, polish the blogpost and move on. Not sure if this is something worth presenting (the software side is basic; it is the analysis that's interesting). 

Then I will get started on developing the MCTS framework. I will begin with high-level diagrams, then start diving into the details of everything (as deep as I can go). Great opportunity to pair here and get advice on how to architect the system. Very important to meet with as many people as possible in this phase. After I have a good idea of how the system can be built, I will start building! I think it will be important to try to get a working prototype done fairly quickly and start iterating on it. The fundamentals of the code-structure should (ideally) be sound from the start, though. Otherwise, refactoring will become a huge headache. 

Consider documenting everything before it is written out in code. This is the high-effort, low-reward (initially) approach that I'm scared of but I am sure it is the right way to build things. Keep in mind making things compatible with a front-end, etc.. A lot to learn here, so learn, learn, learn, think, and only then develop. 

Once the system is working decently, I want to transition my efforts to building out an app. At this stage, it will be important to fully think through how to design the UI. What do I want to get out of it? Another great opportunity to pair (e.g. Ludwig has shown a lot of interest in this space).  


More meta, **how to do**? 

I think it will be useful to find a new environment to spend 2-4 days/wk working at. If I can arrive at this hypothetical space around 9/10am (following a morning of being outdoors; walking, running, cycling) that is a good plan. 

First step of every working day should be to outline the goals and objectives for the day. In this way, I could take things day-by-day (i.e. not have a strict calendar to follow for the full six-weeks). Reflect on the objectives as the day goes on.
